        <episodeDescription>After sharing a kiss at the beginning of the summer, Robin and Barney are unsure how to handle their mutual attraction. After some consideration they tell the gang they have decided to remain just friends, but secretly continue seeing each other. They are able to get away with their secret romance for a couple months, but are discovered when Ted, Marshall and Lily walk in on them together. They explain to the gang that they are happy with their casual relationship, and didnâ€™t want to complicate it by defining it. This is unacceptable to Lily, who pressures them to label their situation, and ultimately locks them in Robinâ€™s room to force them to address it. Meanwhile, Ted is anxious about his first days as a professor at Columbia, which is made worse when he shows up at the wrong class and starts his lecture. </episodeDescription>

Also Penny shares some girl talk with her friends about Leonard and his new girlfriend. When Howard discovers who hacked the account, the guys depart for a quest to Carlsbad, California where the hacker, Todd Zarnecki, lives in order to retrieve the stolen account, along with "enchanted weapons, gladiator armor, gold, and a battle ostrich, Glenn". Despite Sheldon carrying his Bat'leth with him they fail miserably. On the way back their car engine breaks down, and they're saved by Penny, who came to drive them home and upon hearing about their failure promises to show them "How we finish quests in Nebraska" and forces Zarnecki to give up kicking him below waist.</episodeDescription>

        <episodeDescription>When Leonard spends too much time in the shower with Priya, Sheldon charges Leonard with two violations of the roommate agreement. However, before he can get too far, Priya uses her skills as a lawyer to nullify the charges due to the agreement's vague wording, much to Sheldon's dismay. When the guys take advantage of Priya's skills in order to eat Greek food on pizza night, Sheldon goes to Penny, who invites him to a girls' night out with Amy and Bernadette, which Sheldon agrees to after Penny mentions that they may be talking trash about Priya. After the girls drink some cocktails, they decide to take Sheldon dancing, which Sheldon reluctantly goes along with. After dancing, Sheldon takes an intoxicated Amy back to her apartment and as well as talking about Priya, meets a monkey who is addicted to smoking cigarettes. Amy tells Sheldon not to give in to Priya's law skills, before kissing him and going to her bathroom to vomit.</episodeDescription>

        <episodeDescription>Penny is horrified when Amy gives her a gift: a huge, quite horrible painting of the two of them. With no good way to avoid displaying it, she only hangs it up when Amy is over. When Amy catches her taking the painting down, she's embarrassed and angry until Penny lies and says the gift made Bernadette jealous.When the deranged Professor Rothman is forced to retire, both Sheldon and Kripke vie for his office. President Siebert refuses to resolve the dispute, so Leonard arranges a one-on-one basketball game to decide (since they're both equally bad at sports). Neither one can even make a single basket, so they end up deciding by seeing who can bounce the ball the highest. Sheldon wins; unfortunately, the office is not what he'd hoped for: the thermostat is located in the office of a professor going through the hot flashes of menopause (thus Sheldon is too cold), the mockingbird outside his window is off-key with the annoying windchimes, the perpetually naked Professor Rothman refuses to vacate, and the Geology Department upstairs makes too much noise. Finally, Sheldon gets his head stuck in the wall in an existing hole, after which Leonard takes his picture before he goes for help.</episodeDescription>

        <serieDescription>The year is 2030. Ted Mosby is relaying the story of how he met his wife to his daughter and son. The story starts in the year 2005, when then twenty-seven year old architect Ted was spurred on to want to get married after his best friends from his college days at Wesleyan, lawyer Marshall Eriksen, who was his roommate at the time and kindergarten teacher Lily Aldrin, got engaged after nine years of dating each other. Ted's new quest in life was much to the dismay of his womanizing friend, Barney Stinson. But soon after Marshall and Lily's engagement, Ted believed that his life mate was going to be news reporter and aspiring news anchor Robin Scherbatsky, who, despite having had a romantic relationship with her after this time, ended up being who the kids know as their "Aunt" Robin. As Ted relays the story to his kids, the constants are that their Uncle Marshall, Aunt Lily, Uncle Barney and Aunt Robin are always in the picture and thus have something to do with how he got together with their mother.</serieDescription>
